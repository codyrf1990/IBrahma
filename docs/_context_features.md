## Notes on Features:

*   **"Checked" State:** While not a form field, the concept of a "checked" or "confirmed" renewal is crucial for KPIs and progress tracking. This would be managed via a checkbox on each row in `main.js`.
*   **Placeholder Icons:** Many Commander Card icons (Settings, Profile, Help, Email, Calc, Notes) have UI elements but their full functionality depends on `main.js` loading content into the generic modal or performing other actions.
*   **KPI Calculation Logic:** The exact logic for "Total Entered" vs "Total Confirmed" for KPIs needs clarification from `main.js` if `#kpi-total-confirmed` serves both or if there's another element for total pipeline value.
*   **Error Handling:** Generic modals and messages suggest error handling is considered, detailed implementation in `main.js`.

This list is based on the `index.html` structure. The JavaScript (`src/js/main.js`) implements the dynamic behavior and logic for these features.
