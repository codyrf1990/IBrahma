2025-05-05 - Implemented random data pre-population in the Add Renewal modal (`showAddRenewalModal` calling `utils.getSampleFormData`) as a temporary feature to speed up testing.

2025-05-06 - The `.sync-message` element, intended for user feedback notifications (e.g., "Renewal added successfully"), has been styled to appear as a small toast in the bottom-left. However, it is currently set to `display: none !important;` in `style.css` per user request to hide it. JavaScript logic that might attempt to show this message will be overridden by this CSS rule. Consider removing or commenting out the related JS if the notification is permanently unwanted.

2025-05-07 - Context files (_app_overview.md, _context_core_logic.md, _context_data.md, _context_features.md, _context_structure.md) reviewed and updated. _context_structure.md aligned with current file listing. Other files assumed to be largely accurate as direct codebase/commit review was not performed for this update cycle. CHANGELOG.md and DEV_NOTES.md also updated.
